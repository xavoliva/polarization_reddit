( hint : this is why they 're a different department entirely ) . you 'd do well to understand that and how government works . here , this should help you catch-up . URL** > i am sure our president has a better idea than you of which natural barriers work ... hahaha ! what , because of his enormous ... * '' uuuh , brain '' * ? please . just because he holds the title of potus does n't automagically make him smarter than everyone else in the nation . i mean , he may be smarter than some people , but being potus does n't make him more intelligent than everyone . so , maybe consider putting him on a slightly lower pedestal when you go to worship at his feet , mkay ? > its a human tragedy that women and children are dying in our deserts because of illegal immigration . psst . it 's a tragedy that conditions in their countries of origin are so abysmal that they 're fleeing their own homes to seek safety in another country . also , they 're dying because they 're crossing into a **desert** . that 's how natural barriers work . wikipedia : > a natural barrier refers to a physical feature that **protects or hinders travel through or over** . wikipedia ( URL ) > the natural barriers are obviously not a deterrent enough to push people to immigrate at the ports of entry safely . it 's absolutely true that when people are fleeing violence , corruption , and threats to life , they 're willing to do *whatever* they can to escape it , even at the risk of dying in a desert ( or drowning in a river ) . one need but have the tiniest inkling of empathy to understand how people make these sorts of trade-offs . the fact of the matter is that natural barriers *do* work . i agree , they 're not **the** solution on their own . however , you seem to conveniently forget that there are man-made barriers in place ( see the us-mexico border section on environment ) . so , let 's not act as though there 's nothing . > how about you stop spewing msm talking points long enough to critically think through border security after researching us-mexico border geography and the israeli border wall effectiveness . lol . wut ? > want to spend up to 25 billion on a wall one time to save on increased border security ... first , security is n't a `` set it and forget it '' prospect . there will be maintenance costs , personnel costs . it would be a logistical and fiscal nightmare . > ... tracking down cartel human and drug smugglers year after year on top of all the associated trickle down costs like deporting people ... i get it . drugs are an absolute scourge , but do you really think these costs will suddenly stop ? no . they wo n't -because where there 's a demand , there 's a need , and where there 's a will , there 's a way . and it 's naive ( at best ) to think that building a wall will suddenly make it all stop . drugs do n't just come through mexico . i know the trumpster fire has convinced you that 's the sole source , but you really need to *think* about it .   \n",

The test said she’s somewhere between 1/64th and 1/1024th. That isn’t enough to be recognized by any tribe. I’m pasty white Irish with blonde hair, and I have more African American heritage in me than 1/64th (but not much). I would feel like a scumbag who was taking advantage of the system if I had reported myself as African American on college applications (like Warren did with Native American heritage). \n",

You are literally advocating for diversity for the sake of diversity, which got a 29 year old who has never done anything but be a bartender to be an elected senator who has a million things she has promised to her constituents and hasn’t provided one way to actually pay for them. Her horrible politics have nothing to do with her race or her sex. How about we just vote for people and care what they have to say when we believe they have good ideas, and do the opposite when we believe they have bad ideas? Get off of it with giving any weight to a person’s race/sex, as if that makes their ideas any better. At least it will be fun to watch the ship sink for a couple of years so we can see the people who think like this understand why it’s so incredibly flawed.   \n",

When I voted, the people at the polling booth got my ID, my address, had me sign a piece of paper with many other signatures on it, and (most importantly) gave me a verification code that I needed just to log into the voting machine and vote. I even put in the wrong number the first time (9 instead of a 6 or something like that) and it said invalid code. \n",

       "Assumedly, whatever “system” is in place prevents the people behind the booth from just producing fake verification codes without legit voter info. At least, not one that will allow someone to log into the voting machine.\n",

       "So, how does somebody falsify their information and cast a fraudulent vote? Are the verification codes not tied to legitimate voter info like it seems?   \n",

Both pieces of paper had the code that I would need to enter in order to vote. I assume that those papers could not print a code without valid voter info but I could be wrong.

       "18048827  she isn ’ t a fraud because she got elected . she ’ s a fraud because she refuses to debate anyone on the other side , and then calls a debate request catcalling her . she ’ s a fraud because she wants to make sweeping socialist reforms to our economic system but has shown that she doesn ’ t understand basic accounting and thinks that unemployment is low because people have two jobs . she ’ s a fraud because she refuses to ( or is unable to ) explain any of her positions when asked even the most basic questions ( including in interviews with outlets that generally agree with her ) . she is a fraud because she promises elaborate , unachievable things to her constituents and then can not begin to explain how she will pay for them when pressed . oh , she also claims she isn ’ t beholden to special interests because she doesn ’ t take money from big companies ( a good thing ) but on the other side of that token , says she needs permission from the groups of which she ’ s a member before she can do things that she should be able to do on her own . this is a bad look for the left and i love reading these comments of people who eat this up just because “ something something white privilege something something republicans bad something something . ”   \n",
